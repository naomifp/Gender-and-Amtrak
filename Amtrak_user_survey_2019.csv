Most of our quaint businesses are only one story, as if  we forgot that a high-rent business district could build up.  Large surface parking, or parking of any kind is a waste of space in Davis.  A finite number of people can use it, then it's full for the rest of the day.  Better would be timed bus service from six destinations of Davis (N, S, E, W Davis, the MU and the Silo), delivering people within a block or two of the station ten to 15 minutes prior to a train arrival.  Services could be available on-site (coffee, dry cleaner, other services that could appeal to commuters) .  After the train arrives, those buses would wait until people from the train get on and they would shuttle off to their respective destinations.  Currently Unitrans serves the Station with one bus on regular, but unsynchronized schedule.   It is not clear which bus to take.  I imagine a separate Corridor connection schedule available to riders highlighting these timed and guaranteed connections that wait for late trains.  Sure this costs money, but we could make money by getting rid of the parking and building intense land uses around and throughout the station.

There's nothing wrong with the Davis Amtrak station itself. I just came back from European trip where I used trains extensively. Oakland Coliseum station and connection with BART is an area that does need work. Signage in Oakland getting from BART to Amtrak and vice versa is terrible. Public address system (audio) there is barely audible and arrival/departure signboards are difficult to read in normal sunny conditions there. Public safety concerns were also a factor there. In short, coming home from Europe via Oakland Airport - Oakland Coliseum station felt like coming to a dangerous dysfunctional third world country. In comparison, Davis' Amtrak Station is Paradise. It was also ludicrous that Amtrak ticket collection personnel on the train are not equipped with simple Square credit card readers for accepting  credit cards when there is no ticket purchase option at Oakland Coliseum station.

Amtrak provides a service that allows the public to travel without contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and congestion to the same degree as traveling via single-occupancy vehicle. Amtrak is by no means a cheap way to travel and tacking on parking fees is questionable, especially when many Amtrak riders (including myself) are residents of Davis and graduates of UC Davis who were unable to secure employment in Davis due to low job opportunity and therefore must travel outside the city or even county. I understand the economic benefit that comes from the parking fee and that the funds are ""dedicated"" to making improvements to downtown (improvements of course being subject to the opinion of the city and not the residents), but in which case why not convert all downtown street parking to paid? The people parking in downtown to access amenities actually IN the downtown such as restaurants or shopping should be paying towards said ""improvements"", not the people who park at an Amtrak dedicated lot to access the Amtrak, which just so happens to be in downtown  (and most if not all people doing so at 6AM, well before most downtown businesses are even open).

I was there when a guy committed suicide.  It was scary.  Also, the parking on the West-end is dangerous even though its 90 minute parking zone.  There have been several car break-ins in that area. I am concerned if a burglar is caught in the act by a train rider.  They usually carry weapons.  There are no cameras and lighting is poor.  Also, I worry about the low income residents who live in the housing/trailers on the other side of the railroad tracks.  The train noise, horn, and Davis  intercom system must wake them up.  Perhaps it would be better if the Amtrak assistant didn't use the intercom system but instead walk to where the raiders are at and make the verbal announcement at side walk level.

Electric vehicle charging that acknowledges that much of the weekday ridership is commuting to the Bay Area and needs 10 or 12 hours without incurring a parking fine would better encourage hybrid and electric commuting. Beyond those things, I feel the station is not well leveraged as a regional transit hub. Access to and from the station forces commuters through low-speed downtown streets and busy intersections, rather than more direct routing from the nearby freeway or larger boulevards. Regional bus connections are non-existent. Also: station maintenance is often poor, with trash littering the area for days. The track configuration often causes one train to wait while another one is taking on and letting off passengers.

I'm tired of having to ride really fast and take up the whole lane when going to the Co-op, on G between 2nd and 4th.  A pox on everyone associated with all downtown diagonal parking.  A pox on everyone too spineless and/or shortsighted to remind those are are so lathered up about downtown parking that science tells us we have 12 years or less to actually do something about climate change.        Also:  * The station's covered bike parking is seldom used b/c bikes & parts are regularly stolen, and homeless people often sleep there.        * Station grounds were clearly designed by someone who doesn't ride the train.  Need more & comfortable seating options, including shade & (more) shelter.  All that pink concrete just gets hot in the summer & it's a wasteland.  The curved, concrete (?) benches are pretty enough, but not comfortable, and they're isolated so they  get misused & are uninviting.  The ""garden"" areas are neglected and were never inviting or inspiring.  Why?       *Need to prevent drivers from stopping  just in front of the station to pick up & drop off--they block cyclists & auto traffic.      * Cap Corridor has LOUSY customer service and can't be bothered to let us know when the Amtrak bus schedule changes, & can't be relied upon to tell us when a late train's arriving--when you're sitting inside the waiting area in the station on a cold/rainy morning, you can't see the *&%#%$ tracks.  So if the station agent doesn't announce it & you don't hear the train, &, for whatever reason, there's no automatic announcement*, you're screwed.  It's happened to a number of us.  Great way to discourage train ridership. (*one fellow rider was told by a Davis station agent that the speaker(s) in the interior waiting area was broken, and the agent was unaware of any plans to remedy this).  Cap Corridor has great disdain for its customers, which is a shame, since if we want to address climate change, we need to promote transit.      * Been biking for decades, but I no longer encourage people to bike around Davis, and when I'm going somewhere in town at night, I drive more & more frequently.  Day or night, I wear a reflective vest, and I use my arm to signal stops & turns.  I'm tired of having motorists risk my life because of their impatience & carelessness.  Also sick of hearing City of Davis pat itself on the back for its so-called bike-friendliness.  Not so, say I & other cyclists.    As you can see, the Davis Amtrak station touches a lot of raw nerves for me.  Been biking & riding the train for years & I'm really frustrated.
